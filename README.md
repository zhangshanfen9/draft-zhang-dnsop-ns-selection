Abstract

   Nameserver selection algorithms employed by DNS resolvers are not
   currently standardized in the DNS protocol, and this has lead to
   variation in the methods being used by implementations in the field.
   Recent research has shown that some of these implementations suffer
   from significant security vulnerabilities.  This document provides an
   in-depth analysis of nameserver selection utilized by mainstream DNS
   software and summarizes uncovered vulnerabilities.  Furthermore, it
   provides recommendations to defend against these security and
   availability risks.  Designers and operators of recursive resolvers
   can adopt these recommendations to improve the security and stability
   of the DNS.
